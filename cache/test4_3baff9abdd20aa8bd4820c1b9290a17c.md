Your next meter reading is scheduled to occur on or about Jun 13, 2024.

Spring's warm weather often produces thunderstorms, which can cause power outages. If your power goes out, call 1-888-LIGHTSS (1-888-544-4877). For your safety, please treat all downed wires as live and dangerous. For more information on preparing for outages, visit www.firstenergycorp.com/storminfo.

For your safety, if your service has been disconnected, do not attempt to reconnect it. While this is illegal and could result in prosecution, removing a meter base or touching any of the wires can also cause death or serious injury through arcs of electricity, explosions or fire. Meters are only to be accessed by authorized utility personnel.

An important message to dog owners - to ensure that our meter readers' visits to your home are safe and productive, please keep your dog secured in an area away from the path to your meter. All of our employees wear photo ID badges. Always ask for an employee's ID before letting anyone in your home. If you are still not sure, please call the company.
