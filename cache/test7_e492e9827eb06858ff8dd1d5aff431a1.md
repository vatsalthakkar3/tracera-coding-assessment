# SAVE ENERGY.

# A SMART STArT to savings

Saving energy can help you save money. Stay cool with these energy-saving tips:

- Caulk and add weather-stripping to any seams and cracks. If your insulation is lacking, now may be a good time to upgrade or replace it and experience decreased energy costs year-round.
- Change the direction of your ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise in the summer to push cooler air down.
- Install a smart thermostat that can adjust heating and cooling automatically for optimal efficiency and performance.
- Clean or replace the filter on your air conditioner to keep it running efficiently.

For more tips on staying cool and saving energy this summer, visit blackhillsenergy.com/ready.

# SUMMER safety and preparedness

We encourage you to prepare for potential severe weather events and emergencies that could impact your service.

- Prepare an emergency kit so that you have flashlights, a battery-powered radio and extra batteries ready to go.
- Use your generator safely.
- After storms, beware of fallen debris and downed power lines — assume all downed lines are energized.
- Create an emergency action plan with your family.
