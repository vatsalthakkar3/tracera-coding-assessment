# Safety Information

Storm season is approaching, and high winds can bring down power lines. Never approach a downed power line! Keep people, vehicles, and pets at least 20 feet away. Never move any debris around the line as electricity can travel through it, especially when wet. Call Midwest Energy at 800-222-3121, to give the exact location of the downed lines.

Take a moment to point out overhead power lines and other electrical equipment to children and explain what they are. Teach them to never climb trees near lines, and to always look up before flying a kite. Children should stay off utility poles, electrical boxes, and never enter an electric substation. Learn more about electric safety for kids at www.SafeElectricity.org.

# Power Outage Information

With advanced technology Midwest Energy is capable of determining when a power outage occurs. But to help us set the most accurate boundaries, we rely on customer phone calls. To report an outage, call (800)222-3121, 24 hours a day, and follow the voice prompts. To see current outages, visit www.mwenergy.com and click on “view current outages.”

Once the power is out, it's hard to tell when it will return. Leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns. Once it's back on, turn on your appliances one at a time. Consider using coolers with ice to keep food cold, safe, and accessible. Lastly, check on your neighbors to see if they are safe, and offer any assistance that they might need.
