# Value Added Tax (VAT)

VAT on Electricity is charged at the Standard Rate, with the exception of those supplies which qualify as domestic use or non-business use by a charity. Domestic use includes de minimis supplies which do not exceed a daily average of 33kWh across the invoicing period and in this instance a Reduced Rate of VAT is applicable. For qualifying supplies other than de minimis supplies, VAT declaration forms can be downloaded from the customer area on our website www.business.engie.co.uk.

For further information on supplies which qualify for Reduced Rates please visit www.hmrc.gov.uk or contact your VAT advisor.

# Climate Change Levy (CCL)

CCL is a tax on energy delivered to non-domestic users in the UK, with the exception of those supplies which qualify for Reduced Rate VAT. For those supplies which are not exempt a reduced rate of CCL can be claimed for Energy Intensive Businesses that have entered into a Climate Change Agreement (CCA) with the Department of Energy and Climate Change. If your business is eligible for CCL relief you must notify us using HMRC’s PP11 and PP10 forms.

For further information on supplies which qualify for relief from CCL or to obtain forms PP11 and PP10 please visit www.hmrc.gov.uk. This document is a Climate Change Levy Accounting Document (CCLAD).
