Rotating outages are controlled electrical outages used to avoid widespread or uncontrolled blackouts. Your Rotating Outage Group number is located on page 1, upper left, of your SCE bill. Your rotating outage group number may change at any time. For more information, visit www.sce.com/rotating outage.

# What is the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA)?

The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both SCE customers and those who have left SCE service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by SCE on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources.

# Things you should know

# Fixed Recovery Charge

SCE has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires. Your bill for electric service includes a Fixed Recovery Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Fixed Recovery Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to SCE. SCE is collecting the Fixed Recovery Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity.

# DWR Adjustment

This is a refund from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) relating to the purchase of power during the 2000-2001 energy crisis. The adjustment line item will only appear on bills of customers who previously paid the DWR Bond Charge.
